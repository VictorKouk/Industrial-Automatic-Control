Project created during my 3rd year of studying as an electrical and computer engineer. In the subject of Industrial Automatic Control, we were told to create an automation for a factory's conveyors. Objects were transported for a certain time on them and 
got detected from photocells. 
As a bonus I used random generators to create the photocell's signal. 
On .lld files, the programming of PLC is observed.
On zip file the system SCADA is simulated.
